# 1-Bit-PCX-Image-Converter

Motivated by the needs of my company I developed this converter to make some internal processes easier. It can be used by everyone for free.

I only provide source code for the main functions. The version for the company is compiled and will have an UI with some extra settings in future.

Current image output: black and white pxc image file with specific size, undithered
